## Ruby Misc 

- Ruby uses single inheritance 
- `exception.backtrace` 
    - Traceback
- `bundle exec` creates its own environment with Rails gems 
- Path helpers can take in a variable and output the resource path, e.g. `path_to(@role)` results in `/roles/25`
- `Struct` is a convenient way to bundle a number of attributes together, using accessor methods, without using an explicit class 
- Ruby serializes to `yaml`, not `json` by default
